- For files: Copies the actual file content
- Maintains same parent folder

- Appends " 2" to the original title
- Generates new fid (file identifier)
- Copies all metadata including aspects, tags, and properties
- For files: Copies the actual file content
- Places copy in specified parent folder
- Preserves permissions and other settings

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot copy folder nodes

- Builds path from root folder to target folder
- Returns array of folder information in hierarchical order
- Always starts with root folder
- Shows complete navigation path

This tool permanently removes nodes from the system. For folders, it recursively deletes

**Behavior:**
- Permanently removes node from repository
- For files: Deletes both metadata and file content from storage
- For folders: Recursively deletes all children first, then the folder
- Publishes NodeDeletedEvent for each deleted node
- Cannot be undone - deletion is permanent

**Restrictions:**
- Requires write access to the parent folder
- Cannot delete system folders or protected nodes
- Folder deletion requires all children to be deletable
- Some nodes may have delete restrictions based on their type

**Safety considerations:**
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Folder deletion can remove large amounts of data
- Always verify node UUID before deletion
- Consider backing up important data before deletion

**Use cases:**
- Clean up temporary files
- Remove outdated documents
- Delete empty or unused folders
- Maintain repository organization
- Remove sensitive data that should not be retained

- fid: Auto-managed file identifier
- System-specific fields

**Validation:**
- Validates against associated aspects
- Checks parent folder permissions and constraints
- Validates feature definitions for executable nodes
- Ensures node satisfies parent folder filters
- For folders: Validates that new filters don't invalidate existing children

**Special handling:**
- File size updates supported for file nodes
- API keys cannot be updated
- Folder filter changes validate all existing children
- Aspect changes trigger property validation
- Moving nodes validates target parent permissions

**Events:**
Publishes NodeUpdatedEvent with change details for integration and audit purposes.

**Examples:**
- Update title: {"title": "New Title"}
- Add tags: {"tags": ["important", "draft"]}
- Move node: {"parent": "new-parent-uuid"}
