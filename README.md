# Antbox

Antbox is a next-generation, API-first Enterprise Content Management (ECM) platform designed for developers. Built with Deno and TypeScript, it provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building content-rich applications.

At its core, Antbox is a headless content repository, but its true power lies in its extensibility. With a rich set of features like AI-powered agents, programmable actions, and a flexible content model, Antbox can be adapted to a wide range of use cases.

## Key Features

*   **API-First Design:** Every feature is accessible through a comprehensive RESTful API, making it easy to integrate with any application.
*   **Flexible Content Model:**
    *   **Nodes:** The fundamental building block in Antbox. A node can be a file, a folder, or any other content type.
    *   **Aspects:** Extend nodes with custom metadata and behavior. Create your own content types by defining aspects with the properties you need.
*   **Programmable Extensibility:**
    *   **Features:** Write custom server-side logic in TypeScript or JavaScript. Features can be exposed in different ways:
        *   **Actions:** Perform operations on one or more nodes.
        *   **Extensions:** Create custom API endpoints.
        *   **AI Tools:** Extend the capabilities of AI agents.
*   **AI-Powered Agents:**
    *   **Conversational AI:** Create and interact with AI agents that can chat with users and answer questions.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Ground your agents in your own content. The built-in RAG service enables agents to search for relevant information within the repository before answering questions.
    *   **Tool-Using Agents:** Allow your agents to use custom tools (Features) to perform actions and interact with the system.
*   **Pluggable Architecture:**
    *   **Storage Providers:** Store your content where you want. Antbox supports multiple storage backends, including the local file system, Google Drive, and S3.
    *   **AI Models:** Integrate with different AI models and providers.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Manage multiple, isolated tenants from a single Antbox instance.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure your content with a flexible authentication system that supports JWT, API keys, and a granular permission model.

## Use Cases

*   **Headless CMS:** Power your websites, mobile apps, and other digital experiences with a flexible and scalable content backend.
*   **Intelligent Document Management:** Build a smart document repository with AI-powered search and summarization.
*   **Developer Platform:** Use Antbox as a foundation for building your own content-centric applications and services.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Create a centralized knowledge base that your team can interact with through a conversational AI.
*   **Digital Asset Management (DAM):** Store, organize, and manage your digital assets with custom metadata and workflows.
