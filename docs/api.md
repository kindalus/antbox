## Overview

This document describes the REST API for the Antbox system. Antbox is a feature-centric platform that provides unified access to dynamic functionality through features. Features can be exposed as actions, extensions, or MCP tools, providing a flexible architecture for content management and automation.

This document outlines the available endpoints, their responsibilities, and the expected inputs and outputs for each.

| `POST` | `/root` | Authenticate as the root user. |

## Authentication & Authorization

For the majority of the APIs, authentication and authorization are critical. The system uses JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for this purpose. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Fetching the JWT**:
   - Clients can authenticate as the root user by making a `POST` request to the `/login/root` endpoint with the correct password.
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT is returned in the response.

2. **Sending the JWT**:
   - Once obtained, the JWT should be included in the `x-access-token` header of subsequent API requests.
   - The system will verify the JWT to ensure it's valid and hasn't expired. If the JWT is invalid or has expired, the request will be denied.

3. **Tenant Information**:
   - Requests should also include tenant information in the `x-tenant` header. If no tenant is specified, the system defaults to the first tenant in the configuration.

4. **User Information**:
   - Once a JWT is verified, the system extracts the user's details and attaches them to the request context. This allows for fine-grained access control based on the user's roles and permissions.

Ensure that you keep your JWTs safe and never expose them in client-side scripts or other insecure locations.
