# WebDAV Server Implementation Status

This document outlines the current status of the WebDAV server implementation.

## Path Resolution

**Status:** Implemented.

Path resolution is handled by traversing the folder hierarchy from the root. This works with the current `NodeService` but may be slow for very deep paths as it performs a `list` operation on each level of the hierarchy.

## Authentication

**Status:** Implemented.

The WebDAV endpoint is now integrated into the main application and protected by the standard authentication middleware. It supports the same authentication methods as the REST API (Bearer Token and API Key).

## XML Handling

**Status:** Basic implementation.

The implementation still uses template strings to generate XML responses to avoid introducing new dependencies. This approach is functional but not robust for complex XML structures.

**Recommendation:** For future improvements, consider using a proper XML builder library for Deno to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

## WebDAV Features

**Status:** Partially Implemented.

The following methods are now supported:

- `OPTIONS`: Fully supported.
- `PROPFIND`: Supported for files and folders. Handles `Depth: 0` and `Depth: 1`.
- `GET` / `HEAD`: Supported for files. Returns file content.
- `PUT`: Supported for creating and updating files.
- `DELETE`: Supported for files and folders (non-recursive for folders).
- `MKCOL`: Supported for creating folders.
- `COPY`: Supported for files only.
- `MOVE`: Supported for files and folders (by updating the parent and/or title).

### Known Limitations:

- **Recursive Operations:** `COPY` and `DELETE` on folders are not recursive. Only the folder itself is affected.
- **Properties:** `PROPPATCH` is not supported. Reading and writing of extended WebDAV properties is not implemented.
- **Locking:** `LOCK` and `UNLOCK` are not supported. The server is stateless regarding locks.
