Excellent question. To be more aligned with a **modern, lightweight ECM**, Antbox needs to focus on
making its powerful backend capabilities accessible and useful to business users, not just
developers.

The goal of a lightweight ECM is to provide the core benefits of enterprise content
management—process automation, security, and search—without the overwhelming complexity and cost of
traditional systems.

Here is what Antbox needs to focus on:

### 1. A Comprehensive Web Interface

This is the single most critical requirement. A modern ECM is not just an API; it's a destination
where business users work. This interface should be clean, intuitive, and provide a home for the
following features:

- A central dashboard for tasks and notifications.
- An easy-to-navigate repository for browsing and managing files.
- Rich document previews.

### 2. A Visual Workflow Builder

This is the heart of any ECM. While Antbox has an automation engine ("Features"), it needs to be
exposed through a graphical, drag-and-drop interface. A business user, without writing any code,
should be able to build a process like:

- **Trigger:** When a file is added to the "New Invoices" folder...
- **Step 1:** Automatically apply the "Invoice" metadata template.
- **Step 2:** Assign a task to the "Accounts Payable" group for review.
- **Step 3 (Conditional):** If the invoice is "Approved," move it to the "Processed" folder;
  otherwise, send a notification back to the uploader.

This empowers teams to automate their own processes, which is the core value proposition of an ECM.

### 3. User-Friendly Metadata and Search

Antbox's "Aspects" are a powerful concept, but they need to be manageable by non-technical users.

- **Metadata Forms:** When a user looks at a document, the "Aspects" should appear as a clean,
  editable form on the side, not as raw data.
- **Advanced Search UI:** A user should be able to easily build powerful queries without knowing a
  query language. For example, using dropdowns and text fields to find all "Contracts" where the
  "Status" is "Pending Renewal" within the "Next 90 days."

### 4. Enhanced Document Lifecycle Features

To manage documents effectively, users need more than just storage.

- **Clear Version History:** A simple, visual timeline of a document's history. Who changed what,
  and when? With a single click, a user should be able to revert to a previous version.
- **Review and Annotation Tools:** The ability to add comments, highlight text, or even draw on a
  document preview within the web interface to provide feedback.

### 5. Simple Dashboards and Reporting

Managers need visibility into their team's processes. The system should provide simple, pre-built
dashboards that answer questions like:

- How many documents are awaiting my approval?
- What is the average time it takes to approve a contract?
- Which documents are accessed most frequently?

In essence, Antbox has a strong engine, but to become a modern, lightweight ECM, it needs to **build
the user-friendly car around that engine**. The focus must shift from providing an API for
developers to providing a complete, out-of-the-box solution for business teams.
